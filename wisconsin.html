                <img src=images/wiki_werewolf.jpg alt="Werewolf howling" style="width: 40%">
                <p>This creature was first sighted back in the 1930s in or near Elkhorn, Walworth County, Wisconsin. It has been described as being 6-7 feet tall (about 2m) and walking on two or four legs. With glowing eyes and a hair-covered body, the Beast of Bray Road has been compared to a werewolf and bigfoot.</p>

            <h2 id="hodag">Hodag</h2>
            <img src=images/hodag-statue.jpg alt="Hodag statue" style="width: 50%">
            <p>Perhaps the most famous of the list is the Hodag. It is now the official symbol of Rhinelander, WI. Statues of Hodags can be found throughout town, including in front of the chamber of commerce. This cryptid resembles a sturdy rhino mixed with a stegosaurus with the face of a Wild Thing (from Maurice Sendak’s famous children’s book).</p>

            <h2 id="monsters">Lake Monsters</h2>
            <img src=images/sea-monster-chimera-monstrosa-ccc768-640.jpg alt="Sea monster resembling a fish" style="width: 50%">
            <p>Many of Wisconsin's lakes and rivers are home to folkloric creatures of a variety of shapes and sizes. Many tales of these creatures originate with the Native American communities that live(d) there.
